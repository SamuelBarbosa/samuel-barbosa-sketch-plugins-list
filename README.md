# Sketch plugins list
This is a voluntary minimal list of sketch plugins. The idea behind it is not to address all issues possible but more a short list of day-to-day productivity boost plugins.

## Must Have
- [Sketch Runner](http://sketchrunner.com/): a command launcher for sketch. Useful for repetitive tasks and managing plugins easily.
- [Monster](https://github.com/PeachScript/sketch-plugin-monster): manage plugins shortcuts.
- [Craft](https://www.invisionapp.com/craft): could be a list by himself.
- [Auto-Layout](https://animaapp.github.io/): gives ability to do responsive design on your artboards.
- [Comma](https://github.com/margusholland/Comma): text functions missing from sketch.
- [Stark](http://getstark.co/): color-blind simulator and contrast checker.
- [Sketch Palettes](https://github.com/andrewfiorillo/sketch-palettes): a Sketch plugin for exporting and importing fill presets.
- [Font Packer](https://github.com/bigxixi/Font-Packer): collect font files you used in your sketch file.
- [Sketch Guides](https://github.com/luvmex/Sketch-Guides): add Guides to edges and midpoints at once.


## Optional
- [Sketch Measure](http://utom.design/measure/): create documentation.
- [Chromatic](https://github.com/petterheterjag/chromatic-sketch):  create good-looking and perceptually uniform gradients and color scales.
- [Paster](https://github.com/Volorf/Paster): paste text data from clipboard directly to Sketch text layers.
- [Font Finder](https://github.com/ukn530/FontFinder): find fonts item in current page by family.
- [Fontily](https://github.com/partyka1/Fontily): finding & replacing fonts.
- [Compo](https://github.com/romashamin/compo-sketch): buttons and label margins automation.
- [Egmont](https://github.com/interfacemarket/Egmont-plugin): create squircle shapes.
- [Formr](https://github.com/lessthanzero/Formr): maintain proportions of layers and artboards.

## Other good quality plugins
- [States](http://states.design/): create different states and switch between them easily. Just like layer comps for Sketch.
- [Search Everywere](https://github.com/MrPeak/sketch-search-everywhere): find a layer by name, content, or id.
