# Sketch plugins list
This is a voluntary minimal list of sketch plugins. The idea behind it is not to address all issues possible but more a short list of day-to-day productivity boost plugins.

## Must have
- [Anima](https://animaapp.github.io/): Still useful, despite latest features on sketch.
- [Stark](http://getstark.co/): color-blind simulator and contrast checker.
- [Sketch Palettes](https://github.com/andrewfiorillo/sketch-palettes): a Sketch plugin for exporting and importing fill presets.
- [Nudged](https://kevinwoodhouse.github.io/sketch-nudged/): easily edit your nudge distance settings, real time saver for those who use 8px grid.

## Nice to have
- [Automate Sketch](https://ashung.github.io/Automate-Sketch/): A lot of micro-features that can be useful.
- [Rename It](http://rodi01.github.io/RenameIt/): Rename layers and artboards.

## Specifics needs
- [Looper](http://www.sureskumar.com/looper/): automate duplication of groups and layers.
- [PDF Export](https://github.com/DWilliames/PDF-export-sketch-plugin): PDF exporting.
- [Sketch Guides](https://github.com/luvmex/Sketch-Guides): add Guides to edges and midpoints at once.
- [Egmont](https://github.com/interfacemarket/Egmont-plugin): create squircle shapes.
- [Chromatic](https://github.com/petterheterjag/chromatic-sketch):  create good-looking and perceptually uniform gradients and color scales.
- [User Flows](https://abynim.github.io/UserFlows/): Create userflows in sketch. Move your artboard and the arrows will follow.
