# Sketch plugins list
This is a voluntary minimal list of sketch plugins. The idea behind it is not to address all issues possible but more a short list of day-to-day productivity boost plugins.

## Must Have
- [Sketch Runner](http://sketchrunner.com/): A command launcher for sketch. Useful for repetitive tasks and managing plugins easily.
- [Craft](https://www.invisionapp.com/craft): Could be a list by himself.
- [Auto-Layout](https://animaapp.github.io/): Gives ability to do responsive design on your artboards.
- [Comma](https://github.com/margusholland/Comma): Text functions missing from sketch.
- [Stark](http://getstark.co/): color-blind simulator and contrast checker.


## Optional
- [Sketch Measure](http://utom.design/measure/): Create documentation.
